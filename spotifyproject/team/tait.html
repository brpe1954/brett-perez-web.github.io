        <h2>Bio</h2>

            <p>My trends were interesting but not surprising. My listening habits are pretty dominated by my top artist which I rarely stray from. What was interesting was how drastically seasonality affected who I listened to most. We see a big spike in Frank Ocean during some seasons, or Kanye in another that indicates that a certain artist dominates each season. I made spider charts and bar charts to visualize overall key sonic components of the music I listen to, and how my top artists' streams changed season to season, respectively. My story to tell is that my top 5 are consistent but their relative position changes season to season pretty drastically.</p>

                <p>This is a pretty chill playlist for the most part, in terms of what I listen to, and I like the variety. Even though I listen to the same artists frequently, I am surprised at the breadth of different similar artists, even some that are new to me. However, this stays consistent with my favorite artist. Given my top 5 for the season, I think this playlist definitely has a lot of those artists but a good amount of variety nonetheless. I will be bumping this one in the fall for sure. With fall overall my minutes streamed are less than I would expect, I guess typically I am really busy during this time and thus don’t has as much time to listen.</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <p>With winter, I think I want some nostalgic stuff, and something that can keep my energy high as we go through the colder months. The results were carrying in terms of matching my expectations, most tracks here are pretty lowkey, but I like how interspersed are some bangers like Stronger by Kanye West. Still Woozy enters the top 5, which is one of my favorite winter artists to listen to, so that made sense. I might, maybe my tastes have changed this year but this is too sleepy for me overall. I did find it surprising that this was the month where I listened to relatively a lot of music, 3,704 minutes played. WInter is not my favorite season, so maybe I use music to get me through it.</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <p>For spring, I definitely want my energy to be matched by my music, I want some loud music to blare with my windows down, not that the weather is warmer. This playlist pretty well matches that expectation, with some tracks I haven’t heard in a while. I think I will be listening to this one this spring for sure! I love spring, but I guess by the lower minutes streamed compared to the other seasons, I have other things going on. I see that AG Club and Baby Keem entered the mix and those are some of my favorites for more high energy tracks.</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <p>For summer I want to listen to all kinds of music, and maybe this where I have alot of time to explore new things, so for this playlist I don’t want to lean on the very familiar tracks. I want a summer playlist to be high energy but have some songs that are more lowkey as well to balance it out. However, I think this playlist is the most familiar of all of them, which probably says more about me than anything else. My perceptions of the way I listen are sometimes different from reality. I listened to by far the most music this season and I think I can attribute that to my favorite album of the year dropping in the summer, Utopia by Travis Scott. You can see here that he enters the mix heavily. I probably wouldn’t listen to this one, because I played these artists to death and I really want to try to bring more interesting music into my summers.</p>
