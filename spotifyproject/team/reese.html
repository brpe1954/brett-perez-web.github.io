            <p>Going into this project I had expectation of who some of my top artists would be. I have a pretty consistent listening trend throught the year, but I also expected to see more unique information that I wouldnt be able to guess. After completing our analysis, I was most surprised about the quantity of listens I had for some songs, and how much more and less I listened to some songs than others. From my data I decided to build various visualizations, most notably my spider chart and bar chart. With these visualizatations, primarily the spider chart, I set out to showcase the tendencies I have when it comes to what I listen to, primarily the rate of danceability, tempo and energy. I decided to pursue this because of the perceived tendencies I have, and I wanted to see how accurate that was. For the bar chart, I wanted to visualize the rate of which I listen to my top artist and how that trend carried throughout the seasons.</p>

                <p>Overall, I was satisfied with the recommendations I got based on my Fall listening habits and tendencies. There were some song recommended that I already knew or had in playlists, but there was also a good portion of new songs I have not heard prior. I have listened to the playlist a handful of times since we have generated it, and I will continue to going forward. I have also added songs from the playlist to other various playlists previously made by me. There seems to be a trend not just with the Fall playlist, but with each of them. That was that there would be one or two outliers in terms of comparison to the rest of the recommendations. 
                    The artists that made up my top 5 were: Tame Impala, Pond, Flume, Ludwig Goransson and Pink Floyd. I spent a total of 7,103 minutes, or 118 hours listening to music during the fall season. I was not really surprised by this, based on the fact that I know I listen to music each day.</p>

Based on the fact that I know I listen to music each day there was not lots of a surprise, but with the rate of listening lower I was somewhat surprised but it does make sense since I was outdoors more and with people more frequently in the summer.</p>
