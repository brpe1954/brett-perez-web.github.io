    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <div class="bio-box">
        <div class="flex-container">
            <p>When I began this project, I had a few assumptions about my listening habits–some ended up being correct, while others were wrong. I expected to see artists like Playboi Carti, Surf Curse, and Bass Drum of Death in my top five. Those artists have been some of my staples over the past year, and seeing them in concert helped keep them as regulars in my streaming history. However, I wrongly assumed that my average valence (sad songs) would peak in the winter months. I plotted a rolling 30-day average of different audio features for valence, energy, and loudness. It turns out that I was actually listening to more sad music with lower energy and loudness in the months of April and May. This came as a surprise, because I normally associated those months with happy songs and party music to welcome the warmer weather. All in all, this was a great project for learning more about myself. I would recommend anyone curious to know more about their listening habits to go ahead and experiment with the Spotify API.</p>

    <h2>Fall Playlist</h2>
    <div class="box">
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <p class="stats">1,919<br>songs streamed</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <p>This turned out to be one of my favorite seasonal playlists. I appreciated the blend of indie rock, hip-hop, and 90s rock. A solid 90% of the songs were spot on to my music taste, and it was nice to get some recommendations for music I had never listened to before yet ended up favoriting. I ended up streaming a total of 4,200 minutes worth of music, which clocked in at my #2 most heavily streamed season. I think I can attribute the higher streaming numbers to some new albums and memorable concerts I attended for The Garden and Surf Curse during the fall months.</p>

    <h2>Winter Playlist</h2>
    <div class="box">
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <p class="stats">1,229<br>songs streamed</p>
                <p class="stats">2,840<br>minutes played</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <p>I liked my winter playlist as well. It featured a lot more rock and metal than my other seasonal playlists. This is where I got another one of my assumptions confirmed. Before pursuing this project, I had a hunch that I tended to listen to more rock and metal during the winter months. Bands like Bass Drum of Death and Slayer appeared in my top 5 artists which definitely contributed to heavier recommendations popping up in the playlist. My data visualizations featuring rolling 30-day averages confirm that the energy levels were very high in the winter months. But having only streamed 2,840 minutes worth of music, this was my least active season on Spotify. That may be attributed to not attending any notable concerts in the winter months.</p>

    <h2>Spring Playlist</h2>

                <p class="stats">2,676<br>songs streamed</p>

                <p>I was really looking forward to seeing my spring playlist. Despite the data showing I listened to more sad music, it didn’t feel that way looking back on it. I have the most fond memories of spring. When school got out in the middle of May, I went on several long road trips with some of my best friends. We traveled to music festivals and national parks while streaming hours and hours of music along the way. The road trips probably explain why I clocked in 6,275 minutes of streaming, which far and away made this my most heavily streamed season of the year. The playlist recommendations were perfect and accurately suited my listening habits at the time. This playlist features a lot more hip-hop and R&B, while rock music starts taking the backseat.</p>

    <h2>Summer Playlist</h2>
    <div class="box">

                <p class="stats">1,910<br>songs streamed</p>
                <p class="stats">4,112<br>minutes played</p>

            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <p>Summer shares a lot of similarities with my spring playlist. Hip-hop artists were prevalent, and that makes sense to me. During the summer months, I was often hanging out with friends, partying, and listening to music by the creek. In those types of settings, I tend to gravitate towards rap and chill music. It was also no surprise to see Beach Fossils as my number-one artist for this season. They released a new album in June that I was beyond hyped about, and for good reason. It easily became my definitive album of the summer. I streamed a total of 4,112 minutes worth of music and a few hundred of that easily went to Beach Fossils.</p>
