            <p>When pulling my data I expected to see a lot of folk music but I was unsure who would be my top listener. I was guessing that it would either be Caamp or Zach Bryan. I also expected to see some pop in between the artists mentioned above. When I got my data back I was somewhat surprised. Taylor Swift was my top artist with over 1000 listens. While I figured she would be in the top I didn’t expect her to be number 1. Another top listened to artist I was shocked by but found kind of funny was white noise. After reviewing this data I created a spider visualization that showed the danceability, energy, and valence of my music. I also created a bar graph that showed my top 5 artists in each season. In both of these visualizations I saw a lot of similarities over each season. A lot of my top artists repeated throughout the seasons and the energy and danceability of my music was nearly the same at 0.61. I think from these visualizations someone can tell that even though the seasons change I know the type of music I like so I will hardly change what I am listening to. </p>

                <p>I thought that my recommended songs were good recommendations and I would most likely listen to this playlist. However there were some songs that were recommended that I would possibly skip. My top 5 artists were Morgan Wallen, Noah Kahan, Caamp, Louis the Child and Zach Bryan and I had 12,482 minutes streamed. These results were not shocking because I frequently listen to all these artists throughout the year and I go to the Louis the Child concert every fall.</p>

                <p>I liked the results of my recommended songs for the winter playlist however I think I would listen to my fall playlist more than I would listen to my winter playlist. I don’t think the recommendations got anything wrong, it actually gave me some songs I had previously listened to. My top 5 artists for the winter were Zach Bryan, Morgan Wallen, Taylor Swift, Noah Kahan, Luke Combs with 9,168 minutes streamed. I was again not shocked by the artist for this season but I was a little shocked that the number of minutes streamed dropped by quite a bit.</p>

                <p>I really liked the results of my spring recommendations. I thought this playlist had a great variety of artists and I think I would listen to this playlist or my summer playlist the most. I don’t think there was anything wrong with the recommendations but there were a couple recommended artists that I had not heard of before which was fun. My top 5 artists for the spring were Taylor Swift, One Direction, Morgan Wallen, Mt. Joy, and Zach Bryan with 7,491 minutes streamed. Again the only shocking thing about this data was that my minutes streamed were even smaller. I expected it to be one of my higher minutes due to listening to music during ski season.

                <p>As I mentioned above about my spring playlist I also really liked my summer playlist and I think I would definitely listen to this playlist. There wasn’t really anything unexpected about this playlist, I think it did a really good job of grabbing a lot of songs similar to stuff I already listen to. My top 5 artists for the summer was Mt. Joy, Noah Kahan, Taylor Swift, The Lumineers, and Zach Bryan with 9,163 minutes streamed. These results were not shocking, I expected to get results similar to this.
