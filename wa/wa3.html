    <p>Focaccia is a flat leavened oven-baked Italian bread. In some contemporary places, such as Rome, 
        it is a style of pizza, also called <em>pizza bianca</em> ("white pizza"). Focaccia may be served as a side dish
        or as sandwich bread and it may be round, rectangular, or square shape.

    <h2>Etymology and terminology</h2>

    <p>In Ancient Rome, <em>panis focacius</em> was a flat bread baked on the hearth. The word is derived from the Latin <em>focus</em> 'hearth, place for baking'. The basic recipe is thought by some to have originated with the Etruscans, but today it is widely associated with Ligurian cuisine,[citation needed] while outside Liguria the word usually refers to the Genoese variants.

        The first attestation of the word <em>focaccia</em> dates back to the 14th century.
        
        Focaccia is sometimes considered to be a variant of pizza in publications outside Italy, although focaccia is left to rise after being flattened, while pizza is baked immediately.
